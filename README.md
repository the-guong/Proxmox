### About

Ports the [Proxmox VE Helper Scripts](https://github.com/community-scripts/proxmoxve) project to ARM64.

Fork notice

This repository is a fork created because the original project and its references are not compatible with certain environments and cannot be easily solved upstream (see discussion: https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/discussions/8126). This fork exists strictly for backwards compatibility on boards that cannot be updated due to custom boot loaders such as the RK3588. For background on RK3588 Buildroot specifics see: https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/Buildroot#Buildroot_for_RK3588

All original credit belongs to the upstream projects:

- https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE
- https://github.com/asylumexp/Proxmox

Find the scripts on the website linked above.

Any issues with the scripts, please put an issue within this repository rather than upstream, as it is likely caused by my modifications.

### Support

If you would like to offer support, I would appreciate a star on the repository, or for you to support the creator of the Proxmox scripts [tteck on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/D1D7EP4GF)!
